# Train-accident
There are several excellent notebooks to study data science competition entries. However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.
Workflow stages
The competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.
Question or problem definition.
Acquire training and testing data.
Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.
Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.
Model, predict and solve the problem.
Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.
Supply or submit the results.
